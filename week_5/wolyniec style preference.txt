My preference is strongly toward tile style one, because of the classic feel of it. 
It looks more 'typical' because it's utilitarian, achieving a stylistic look without
sacrificing any of the core features to do so. A lot of sites try to be something 
that they're not without fully understanding why (think Yahoo! circa 2004) simply
because that seems to be what their competitors have. I've put in a fair amount of
thought and I want the presentation of the site not to be too distracting from the
ghost facts located on it. Simply put, the navigation on the site will be so classic 
that it won't require any learning.
Because of this, I don't feel that anything beyond a simple style tile is warranted.
